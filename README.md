# AI-Video-Summarization-and-Highlights-Generation
An AI-driven system that automatically summarizes videos and extracts key highlights using machine learning and computer vision.


Overview
  This project focuses on developing an AI-powered video summarization system that extracts key moments from lengthy videos. By utilizing machine learning and computer vision, the system automatically generates concise video summaries while preserving critical information.

Features
  AI-based Video Summarization – Converts long videos into short, meaningful summaries.
  Automated Highlights Extraction – Identifies and extracts the most important moments.
  Customizable Summaries – Users can set summary length and focus on specific topics.
  Enhanced Video Accessibility – Helps users quickly grasp key content without watching full videos.

Technologies Used
  Deep Learning (for feature extraction and summarization)
  Computer Vision (for scene and object recognition)
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) (for speech-to-text processing)
  Python & OpenCV
  FFmpeg (for video processing)
